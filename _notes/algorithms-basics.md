Sorting **in place**
* Only a constant number of array elements are stored outside of the input array at any time.

A sort is **stable** if two elements with equivalent keys maintain their relative position after the sort.

# Algorithm Design Guidelines
* Always know brute-force approach
    * Will give a baseline runtime analysis

* Avoid computation by saving states
* Simplify by pre-computing
* Divide and Conquer
* Scanning

# Greedy Algorithms
* At a choice within an algorithm, the algorithm makes the best choice at the moment.

> Greedy algorithms make the decision of what to do next by selecting the best local option from all available choices without regard to the global structure. -**Algorithm Design Manual**
