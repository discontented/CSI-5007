Sorting **in place**
* Only a constant number of array elements are stored outside of the input array at any time.

A sort is **stable** if two elements with equivalent keys maintain their relative position after the sort.

# Algorithm Design Morals
* Always know brute-force approach
    * Will give a baseline runtime analysis

* Avoid computation by saving states
* Simplify by pre-computing
* Divide and Conquer
* Scanning
